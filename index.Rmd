## Problem

Many people do not know when they will run out of money 
after they have retired.  The reason is that they do not have 
good projections of their financial statuses.
Some people have to cope with poverty,  get into debt, 
or return back to work after retirement.

## Solution

The solution is a retirement calculator.
It allows a user to see his financial future.
After a user enters a few pieces of personal information, 
the application will project his investment value, income and spending each year.

## Retirement Financial Projection at Your Finger Tips
```{r echo=FALSE }

retirement.schedule <- function(i.age,i.investment,i.rincome,i.spending,rate.of.return,rate.of.inflation){
    
    Max.Years = 50
    Age <- rep(0,Max.Years)
    Investment<- rep(0,Max.Years)
    Rincome <-  rep(0,Max.Years)
    Spending <- rep(0,Max.Years)
    change.in.investment <-rep(0,Max.Years)

    Age[1] <- i.age
    Investment[1] <- i.investment
    Rincome[1] <- i.rincome
    Spending[1] <- i.spending
    change.in.investment[1] <-  Rincome[1]- Spending[1]

    for (i in 2:Max.Years){
        Age[i] <- Age[i-1]+1
        Investment[i] <- (Investment[i-1] + change.in.investment[i-1]) * (1+rate.of.return) 
        Rincome[i] <- Rincome[i-1] * (1+rate.of.inflation)
        Spending[i] <- Spending[i-1] * (1+rate.of.inflation)
        change.in.investment[i]= Rincome[i] - Spending[i]
    }

    temp <- data.frame(Age, Investment,Rincome, Spending)
    names(temp)[3] <- "Retirement Income"
    retirement.schedule <- temp
